Knight and Knave - CS50 AI
This repository contains the solution to the Knight and Knave logic puzzle, implemented as part of Harvard's CS50 AI course. The puzzle involves determining whether characters are Knights (who always tell the truth) or Knaves (who always lie), based on a series of logical statements.

Features
Logical Reasoning: Implements propositional logic to deduce the identity of each character.
Python-Based: Uses Python's logical tools and constructs to automate reasoning.
Scalable: Can be adapted to similar logic puzzles with minimal changes.

How It Works
Input Representation: Each puzzle is represented as a series of logical statements.
Logic Analysis: Uses logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to model and solve the puzzle.
Output: Returns the identities of characters (Knight or Knave).
